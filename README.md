## Project Overview
CustomerSegmentationUsingKMeans is a project that demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history and behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). It contains the following columns:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Spending score assigned by the store based on customer behavior

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:
- `CustomerSegmentationUsingKMeans.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis and K-means clustering implementation
- `Mall_Customers.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis

## Requirements
To run the project, you need the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CustomerSegmentationUsingKMeans.git
   cd CustomerSegmentationUsingKMeans
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
**jupyter notebook CustomerSegmentationUsingKMeans.ipynb**

## Analysis and Results
The notebook contains the following steps:
1. Importing Libraries: Importing necessary libraries for analysis and visualization.
2. Data Exploration: Exploring the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
3. Data Preprocessing: Preparing the data for clustering by scaling the features.
4. K-means Clustering: Implementing K-means clustering to group customers into segments.
5. Visualization: Visualizing the clusters to interpret the results.
